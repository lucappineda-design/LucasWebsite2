            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project is about creating a complete graphical scene using Python’s Turtle graphics module.
                The code builds the scene out of smaller drawing functions that position and combine shapes into
                a larger picture. Each function controls details like color, size, and placement so that different
                parts of the scene can be reused or adjusted without rewriting everything. Overall, the program
                demonstrates structured problem-solving by organizing the artwork into clear, readable pieces of code.

            <h2>Sample Code</h2>
            <p>
                The following sample shows how one of the drawing functions uses parameters, loops, and helper
                functions to create a composite shape in the scene:
            </p>

            <pre><code>
def draw_flower(t, x, y, petal_color, center_color):
    """Draw a flower at (x, y) with colored petals and a colored center."""
    # Move to starting position without drawing
    jump_to(t, x, y)
    t.pencolor(petal_color)
    t.fillcolor(petal_color)

    # Draw petal ring
    for _ in range(8):
        draw_circle(t, 10)   # basic circle helper
        t.left(45)           # rotate for the next petal

    # Draw flower center
    jump_to(t, x, y)
    t.pencolor(center_color)
    t.fillcolor(center_color)
    draw_circle(t, 6)
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                In this sample, the <code>draw_flower</code> function takes the turtle object and several parameters
                that control where the flower is drawn and what colors it uses. The code first jumps to the starting
                position without leaving a line, so the flower can be placed anywhere in the scene. It then uses a
                <code>for</code> loop and a fixed rotation to draw a ring of circles, which together look like petals.
                After the petals are drawn, the turtle returns to the center and draws a smaller circle in a different
                color to represent the middle of the flower. This approach makes it easy to reuse the same function
                to create many flowers with different positions and color combinations.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Scene</h2>
            <p>
                Below is the final turtle graphics scene produced by my program:
            </p>

            <img src="P2PTO.png"
                 alt="Final turtle graphics scene created for Project 5"
                 style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-bottom: 12px;">

            <p>
                The final picture shows a complete turtle graphics scene composed of multiple shapes arranged into
                a cohesive design. Different elements are drawn using separate functions, which are layered to create
                depth and variety in the image. Colors, positions, and sizes are carefully chosen so the whole scene
                feels balanced and visually interesting. Together, they demonstrate how simple geometric drawing
                commands can be combined to build a detailed and expressive graphic.
