            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                I am a business student at the University of Oregon pursuing a concentration in Accounting and Marketing, 
                with a minor in French. I am passionate about creative media, entrepreneurship, and building meaningful 
                projects that connect people and brands. Through my work with LP Viral Productions, I have produced 
                high performing video content for restaurants, influencers, and local businesses using professional camera 
                equipment, drones, and advanced editing software. My work experience in both fast-paced restaurant 
                environments and client facing roles has strengthened my communication, leadership, and organizational 
                skills. I am multilingual in Spanish, French, and English, and I enjoy combining creativity, business 
                knowledge, and technical skills to bring ideas to life and support the growth of the organizations I work with.

    <h2>Featured Projects (CS110)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong><a href="project2.html" target="_blank">Project 2 – Your Project Title</a></strong>
            <p>
                Project 2 focuses on breaking down a larger program into small, reusable functions 
                that each perform a specific task. The project demonstrates how parameters, loops, and
                structured code design can be combined to build a clear and organized Python program.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong><a href="project3.html" target="_blank">Project 3 – Your Project Title</a></strong>
            <p>
                Project 3 focuses on improving the Turtle Graphics scene from Project 2 by reorganizing the code into
                cleaner and more efficient functions. The goal is to break large tasks into smaller pieces, remove repeated
                code, and make the program easier to modify. This refactoring allows the scene to be expanded more easily
                and supports creating a more detailed final design.
            </p>

        <li>
            <strong><a href="project5.html" target="_blank">Project 5 – Your Project Title</a></strong>
            <p>
                A description of Project 5. Mention the problem you solved, any interesting code
                you wrote, or how this assignment helped you understand new CS110 concepts.
